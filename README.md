Changing History is an expansion for KSP Realism Overhaul and Realistic Progression One (RP-1). The goal of this project is to expand the lategame, adding technology, contracts, and mechanics to truly give the player the oportunity to create an ideal future in the Post-Apollo Era. We are inspired by alternate history, such as *Eyes Turned Skyward*, in addition to many real concepts that never got the funding or time they needed to see actual flight. Our hope is that we can add these things and so much more, enabling players to truly reach for the stars and do things once thought unimaginable
